Hi! I'm Tim Addison and this is my blog.

I love to build things and really understand how they work.  Right now I'm focused on:

- Building engineering teams to deliver more impact at increasing scale
- Securing a rapidly growing organisation
- Finding, hiring, and growing engineers

Technologies I'm particularly interested in at the moment:

- SQL Server (specifically availability groups, SQL 2017, SQL 2019, and SQL on Azure IAAS)
- Kusto/Azure Data Explorer
- ATP Suite & Azure Sentinel

If you'd like to talk to me about any of these shoot me an email or get in touch via Twitter (DMs are open).
