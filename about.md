Hi! I'm Tim Addison and this is my blog.

I love to build things and really understand how they work.  Right now the three things that I am particularly interested in are:

- SQL Server
- Scaling an engineering organisation

If you'd like to talk to me about any of these shoot me an email or get in touch via twitter.  Unless you're a recruiter, in which case please don't!
