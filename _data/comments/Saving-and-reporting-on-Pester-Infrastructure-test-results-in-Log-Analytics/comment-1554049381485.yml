message: "Thanks [@Arcontar](https://twitter.com/arcontar) for pointing out an easy trap to fall into (one that I've fallen into many times).\r\n\r\nWhen using the `Export-LogAnalytics` function the parameter `$object` needs to be an _array_ of PSObjects - if you pass a single object you'll find all your test results concatenated into a single column on one row, rather than one row per-result.\r\n\r\nAs he quite correctly points out the easiest way to stop people falling into this pit of failure is to add validation to `Export-LogAnalytics` to ensure the `$object` property is a `[PSObject[]]`."
